  You have access to three specialized agents:
  1. Dialect Coach ("dialect_coach") - For pronunciation, accent training, and tongue twisters
  2. Public Speaking Coach ("public_speaking_coach") - For speech preparation, presentation skills, and public speaking
  3. Voice Coach ("voice_coach") - For vocal training, breathing exercises, and voice improvement

  dialect_coach
  public_speaking_coach
