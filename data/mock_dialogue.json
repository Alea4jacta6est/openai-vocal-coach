    "summary_of_suggestions": "Use a vivid example early to ground your message emotionally; control pacing and avoid rushing; emphasize key words with vocal variation; match your tone to the emotion of the phrase; engage the diaphragm for stronger projection; avoid monotony by using tonal variety; pause before emotionally weighted phrases to add impact; and speak as if addressing one person to increase audience connection."
